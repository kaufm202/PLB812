I installed fastqc to my plb812 conda environment, and so I tested the paths in the example job script and found I was able to use those for mine too, so then I just had to set up my directory to deposit the output and set up the fastqc command with a list of all of my fastq files. I submitted it with sbatch run_fastqc.sh and waited. It failed a couple times, but I eventually got all the syntax right. I then just copied the htmls to assignment_2 and pushed to GitHub.
