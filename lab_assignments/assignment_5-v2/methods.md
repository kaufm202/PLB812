Continuing from the blunders of the past, I went to Phytozome for the new Araport 11 annotations. I went back to and just made the small modifications needed to reconstruct an index and realign the reads to the updated genome, then reran the counts and it worked as intended. Looking at the counts from stranded and unstranded, it was clear that these are unstranded since my counts were about half when I ran the counts as stranded.
