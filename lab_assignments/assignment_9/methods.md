I first downloaded the three fasta files from JGI using the command line download they provide, then unzip everything and renamed to simpler names. I then used "orthofinder -f fasta" to run OrthoFinder on SLURM. It ran with no error and outputted the approporiate directories.

I used "wc N0.tsv" to get number of lines and then subtracted one for the headers. I used "grep AT4G28490 N0.tsv" but it returned no results, so apparently no orthologs were found for that gene. I tested an A. thaliana Rubisco small subunit with "grep AT5G38410 N0.tsv" and did get results for that. We were then instructed to search for orthologs of AT5G13930, so I ran "grep AT5G13930 N0.tsv" and recorded the outputs in results.txt.
